# üêÆ Wisecow ‚Äì Kubernetes Deployment Project  

This project is part of my **Accuknox DevOps Trainee Practical Assessment**.  
It demonstrates the **containerization and deployment** of the **Wisecow** web application on a **Kubernetes cluster**, with **CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions**, and an optional **TLS setup** for secure communication.

## üß© Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Wisecow Deployment  

Deploy the **Wisecow** application as a **Kubernetes app** with containerization, CI/CD automation, and secure communication.  

### ‚úÖ Requirements  
- Create a **Dockerfile** for the Wisecow application.  
- Write **Kubernetes manifests** to deploy it in a cluster.  
- Expose the Wisecow service via a **Kubernetes Service**.  
- Configure **GitHub Actions** for automatic Docker image build and push.  
- *(Optional Challenge Goal)* Enable **TLS** for secure HTTPS communication.

## üß∞ KubeArmor Policy (Zero Trust)

A Zero-Trust KubeArmor Policy was written to enhance workload security for the Wisecow app.
It restricts access to sensitive system files.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
During testing, due to local system configuration, I encountered issues enforcing the block access rule in KubeArmor.
All other configurations and policies were successfully applied.
